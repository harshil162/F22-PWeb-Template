                    <h3>PlantAmor</h3>
                    <p>I led a group of 3 students during the UF SHPE Code for Change hackathon to develop a resource for nature enthusiasts to learn about various 
                        plant life with the hopes of expanding STEM education.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My contributions to this project: developing the frontend features (ex. clickable buttons and user navigation) for users to learn about the 10,000+ plants fetched 
                        from the Plant API, and basic styling of the website for user-friendliness.

                    <h3>Gator Space</h3>
                    <p>I worked with 3 other students during the UF Swamphacks IX on a forum that displays information about various student organizations of UF and
                    their meetings. Given it can be hard for studets to find engaging clubs, any club can advertise their events publicly and explore convenient meeting 
                    areas, and users can identify the locations for the campus events.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                    My contributions to the project: adding and modifying JavaScript and CSS code with the intent of implementing features to
                    display club events, as well as, style those features on a basic level
                    </p>

                    <h3>Music Accessor</h3>
                    <p>This static web application allows users to search for and listen to specific songs that are accessible in the 
                    application. A customizable JSON database consisting of currently 20 songs is utilized by the app. Anyone can 
                    modify the database to make a personal playlist. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The list stores names, artists, genres, and YouTube links of the songs. I used React.js and HTML to enable users
                    input for song names and provide respective links to use. I deployed the website using AWS Amplify. As the 
                    first personal project I made with React.js, I enjoyed learning web development.

                    <h3>PoliTracker</h3>
                    <p>With political polarization intensifying during the 2024 election season, social media has become a steady source of political engagement on various issues. 
                        I made this machine learning project to learn the basics of machine learning while tracking political topics discussed across Facebook, Instagram, and X (Twitter).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I utilized Python to read in a CSV dataset and extract necessary data. I encoded data either through numerical or label encoding depending on whether specific data was 
                    numeric or categorical. I applied the K-Prototypes clustering algorithm to cluster both numerical and categorical data and then later group data into 5 clusters. Each cluster 
                    gave information about most and least discussed political topics per social media platform. I finally used FastAPI to visualize and track results.

                    <h3>PixelPalate</h3>
                    <p>For too many cooks and culinary enthusiasts, it is difficult to keep track of various food recipes we already like or may want to try out 
                        stored in a physical cookbook. I worked with 3 other students to develop a virtual recipe book application that addresses this problem
                        through effective storing of recipes, enable various user options for learning the details of recipes, and an interactive game. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My contributions to the project: I used React.js to handle frontend operations such as saving of recipes. I wrote code for 
                    users to view cards of food recipes and managed states among parent and child classes to pass data effectively between the classes. I also wrote
                    code to ensure the user can be pointed to links to detailed information about recipes from the Spoonacular API.
